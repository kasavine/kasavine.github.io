    "contentOneDescription": "The founder of the academy began his teaching career back in 2011. Viacheslav taught both at classical universities and institutes and online. However, from the very first years of teaching, he was disturbed by several observations:",
    "contentTwoDescription": "Quality education costs a lot of money, as the most expensive aspect is the teacher.",
    "contentThreeDescription": "In the modern world, the value of theory is minimal, since it is available to everyone, but at the same time, it is theory that forms the basis of all courses.",
    "contentFourDescription": "It became obvious that the problems that the classical model of education solves do not correspond to the problems that students often come with.",
    "contentFiveDescription": "Having gained experience in Silicon Valley and created many successful teams and products, Viacheslav developed his own problem solving methodology",
    "contentSixDescription": "(User Oriented Development Process). On the one hand, the methodology focuses on today's needs of students, and on the other hand, it is cheaper than classical education systems.",
    "contentSevenDescription": "This was the beginning of the Academy. We have formed a team of like-minded people who believe that quality Stanford-level education can be a reality at Coursera's price tag. It was then that we founded the community of today's academy with the goal of finding a new methodology based on UODP.",
    "contentEightDescription": "The program of each course focuses on practice as much as possible, with a minimum of theoretical foundations. Each block of the course is based on real-life tasks that programmers constantly face."

(It seemed to me just as ideal as possible, because my plans to act on time were violated by some everyday things, or ignorance of some things, or something else, and I wouldn’t fit into an intensive day-by-day without holidays).<br /><br />It's a really cool thing to have <strong>reviews by different people</strong>, where you see different people's perspectives on programming tasks.",
    "customerTwoName": "Vladislav Udovichenko",
    "customerTwoDescription": "I have been familiar with Java for quite a long time, but still I learned some little things, I don’t even know how to describe them. I also remembered something that had long been forgotten due to the fact that it is little used in practice.<br /><br />Most of all I liked the way the training goes, the atmosphere in the group: <strong>online meetings</strong> where people share their work experience, <strong>teamwork</strong>, the opportunity to try yourself as a mentor, learn not only to write code, but to be able to explain it, also <strong>reading someone else's code</strong>.",
    "customerThreeName": "Mikhail Vyuzhanin",
    "customerThreeDescription": "Within three weeks, as a beginner, I managed to acquire quite a lot of basic practical knowledge, such as: maven, CLI, tests, and working with them.<br /><br />During the course, I created and wrote good portfolio programs, for example, a calculator, a progressBar, and a List implementation created from scratch. But the most important thing that this course can give a beginner is <strong>programmer thinking</strong>, when you have to independently carry out your implementation of the task, as in a real job from a customer.<br /><br />A very cool teaching method, with really difficult, but well-thought-out tasks, which, yes, you will have to spend a lot of time on, but upon completion of which, you will be sure that it was really worth it and you didn't do it all in vain.",
    "customerFourName": "Sergey Zakharov",
    "customerFourDescription": "In this course, I figured out how maven works, how generics and lists are organized. Writing my own String gave me an understanding of how String works under the hood.<br /><br />I liked everything! Assignments are well designed. You have to carefully read a project specification for the correct writing of the code. Mentors help to deal with even the most stupid questions. Advice and information from the life experience of Evgeny Karpunin (motemere#9886) were also useful. Special thanks to him.<br /><br />It was also <strong>useful to communicate</strong> with classmates. <strong>Livecoding</strong> is great too. It teaches you not to be shy about your code and to understand someone else's code, to see how the code is implemented by others.",
    "customerFiveName": "Vlad Vaylupov",
    "customerFiveDescription": "During the course, I got exactly what I expected, namely the idea of coding and understanding of the basics of the Java language. I came to the course with almost empty luggage of knowledge.<br /><br />The course is built in an extremely interesting way. It literally makes you <strong>break away from theory and start doing tasks</strong>. Thus, you have to look for the necessary theory by solving problems.<br /><br />A cool feature is the review, which makes it possible to find many cool solutions or see flaws in your code. It is impossible not to write about the fact that calls are held every day where you can learn useful information from experienced guys or get support.",
    "customerSixName": "Konstantin Timofeev",
    "customerSixDescription": "Most of all I liked the fact that there was the possibility of <strong>joint problem solving</strong>, it helped a lot and motivated me not to give up and move on.<br /><br />There was no feeling that you were «one on one» with all this, which, personally, helped me a lot in my studies, although I could not complete all the tasks, however, without the help of colleagues, I would not have been able to do even so much! Thank you, very good course, I have been looking for something like this for a long time!",
    "customerSevenName": "Sergei Bulygin",
    "customerSevenDescription": "The tasks were all very interesting, something was simple, some things took a lot of effort, but this is for someone who is already somehow familiar, for beginners, I think everything was difficult. I would especially like to note the implementation of String, convertToCharArray, combinatorics tasks, progress bar, and, of course, tic-tac-toe.<br /><br />I liked everything!) Especially the idea itself, when you can sit down and code with someone, moreover, it’s not that one writes everything and the other looks, but the fact that <strong>the work is done together and complement each other</strong>, this immediately removes such an effect as the fear of the first line. I suffered a lot from this, I couldn’t pronounce the algorithm in my mind, now it’s much easier to start writing it myself.<br /><br />And the atmosphere itself, as it is fashionable to say now, is lamp-like, the guys were all responsive, helped, prompted.<br /><br />Of all the time that I studied java, these 2 weeks (the last 2 I was unable to participate due to computer failure) were the most productive, and gave a big boost and push, so that after accelerating after bootcamp, do not stop)) Thank you very much for your work.",
    "customerEightName": "Irina Zakharevich",
    "customerEightDescription": "Before that, I didn't know Record, Optional, didn't work with multithreading.<br /><br />I liked that this is a normal project, <strong>close to a real work task</strong>. Anyway there is a lot of information and courses on the basics, but there is nothing deeper.<br /><br />Although this course cannot be completed the first time without practical experience — if you just passed some basics. But how lacking <strong>such in-depth courses</strong>! I will definitely come to all the next courses.",
    "customerNineName": "Ruslan Kolesnikov",
    "customerNineDescription": "I really liked the course, although <strong>it was quite hard</strong>, on many tasks I really sat from morning to evening and sometimes even more, since there was such an opportunity.<br /><br /><strong>I would like to go to the bootcamp again</strong>, I would have solved many tasks differently now — I was exactly the kind of person who shoved all my code into the main. Only on the last task — tic-tac-toe, after the review with Sergey, I started trying to split my code into different methods and classes.<br /><br />In the end, I did it and I liked it.",
    "customerTenName": "German Malinovsky",
    "customerTenDescription": "During the implementation and subsequent buffer fixes, I realized how your initial vision of how it will be used, diverges from how it can actually be used differently and how much everything in the implementation of a seemingly simple task needs to be foreseen.<br /><br />I can't say that I liked the mistakes from the previous weeks :), but <strong>I really liked</strong> the fact that something large-scale is being done and at the same time, step by step, every week some kind of new layer is made, which is based on your previous day. Of course, the preliminary splitting of the task into interfaces and stub classes helped a lot in this, but for now it seems that the main thing in creating your own library is to choose the right abstractions.",
    "customerElevenName": "Alexey Astakhov",
    "customerElevenDescription": "Firstly <strong>the course is as practical as possible</strong>, literally from the very first day I started writing code. I had to quickly get acquainted with the development environment (idea) and the build system (maven), which undoubtedly brings me closer to «combat conditions» =)<br /><br /><strong>Communication with colleagues / classmates</strong> helped a lot, since among them there were many people with commercial experience in Java programming, which made it possible during the review to receive feedback on how it is «customary to write» in real work and a little chill on general topics).",
    "customerTwelveName": "Natalya Klabukova",
    "customerTwelveDescription": "For me, the main thing in this course was that I had to <strong>solve some problems every day</strong>, because I had already gone through all the theory mentioned, but this knowledge is very quickly forgotten without practice.< br /><br />Most of all I liked the fact that I had to <strong>show and discuss my solution</strong> with other course participants who could suggest and show you something. For example, how to do better, or just look at other ways to implement a task and compare it with your own, try to understand other people's solutions. It was also very interesting to <strong>run applications from the console</strong>, before that I had never had to do this in practice.<br /><br />And one more thing, <strong>joint review</strong> helps a lot to share practical knowledge, for example, what «tricks» can be used in the development environment, how to set up the same launch from the console, and all sorts of other useful buttons."
